Step 1: Data Cleaning:
Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset.
When combining multiple data sources, there are many opportunities for data to be duplicated or mislabeled.



Step 2: Data Processing:
Methods of processing must be rigorously documented to ensure the utility and integrity of the data. Data Analysis involves actions and methods
performed on data that help describe facts, detect patterns, develop explanations and test hypotheses.



Step 3:Data Visulization Using( R Programming languages):
Data visualization is the representation of data through use of common graphics, such as charts, plots, infographics, and even animations. 
These visual displays of information communicate complex data relationships and data-driven insights in a way that is easy to understand.
